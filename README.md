# Poet

A fancy-looking CLI program for navigating and managing folders of text files. I built this to manage and display my poems nicely, and has some basic functionality to it.

## Features

- **Directory-based poem browsing**: View poems from a specific directory.
- **Interactive navigation**: Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate between poems, scroll through content, and open poems for editing.
- **File management**: Open and edit poems directly from the terminal.
- **Responsive to terminal dimensions**: Adapts to the size of the terminal window for optimal display.

## Usage

```bash
./poem_reader.sh [-h] <directory>
```
